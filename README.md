This tool allows access to the console as well as loading some unreleased tracks. 

**Please note that this tool is not stable and you will encounter multiple crashes.**

## How to use

Download the compiled DLL on the [Releases](https://github.com/imgemmy/KartKraft-Tool/releases) page.

Inject the DLL into `project_k-Win64-Shipping.exe` using your favorite injector. [Master131's Extreme Injector](https://github.com/master131/ExtremeInjector/releases)

Load into any track/kart combo, and then load one of the unreleased tracks.
## FAQ

#### Binds
'Insert' opens/closes the menu.

'F2' opens the console.

#### Game Constantly Crashing
Crashes are expected due to the release being unstable and UE4 voodoo. However, if you are experiencing constant crashes, or when not injected, then select a different stock track before joining and optionally delete your project_k folder in appdata/local.

#### Console Usage
Using the console you can enter in any UE4 console commands, a full list can be found [here.](https://framedsc.com/GeneralGuides/ue4_commands.htm)
This means you can also load in other unreleased (broken) tracks.
